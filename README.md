To complile it yourself do the following:

This program is written in C++ so if you want to save it as an application you must use something like g++ to compile

make sure to go to the msys2 program

then in a command line cd to the directory that you saved the .cpp file
once there use this command:
g++ -std=c++14 PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.cpp -o PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.exe

you can now run the program in that same directory, just type this in the command lin and hit enter:
PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.exe

Also this .exe file can be found in the folder that we just compiled in, so you can double click like any other program

[Easy method]
You can also download the exe file that I have here on GitHub. Its self signed, so run it at your own risk.

To run the exe you will need to do the following:

1- Download the latest PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.exe

2- Navigate to the library branch here on git hub and download that zip file

3- Make a new folder anywhere that you'd like it

4- Extract the library zip folder and add the files to the new folder you created

5- Add the exe file to that same new folder

6- Try to run the exe. It may get a message from Windows Defender because the exe is self signed. Its your choice if you want to run the program from here.

7- Thats it! it should work, and now you have a simple tool to calculate fuel for simRacing!
