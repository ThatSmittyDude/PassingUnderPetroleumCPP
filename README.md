This program is written in C++ so if you want to save it as an application you must use something like g++ to compile

make sure to go to the msys2 program

then in a command line cd to the directory that you saved the .cpp file
once there use this command:
g++ -std=c++11 PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.cpp -o PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.exe

you can now run the program in that same directory, just type this in the command lin and hit enter:
PassingUnderPetroleumCPP.exe

Also this .exe file can be found in the folder that we just compiled in, so you can double click like any other program
